# Joo
Joo is a programming language and computing platform that is designed to run on machines
with extremely low resources like microcontrollers.

## The Joo language
is a clean, fast, static typed, general purpose language. It's primarily thought to be
compiled to joo bytecode and run by the joo virtual machine.

## The Joo virtual machine
is a virtual computer that can be programmed using the joo bytecode. It's designed to
be easilly extensible and customizable.

virtual machine tech specs:
* 1024 characters program memory
* 64 variables + functions + arrays
* 108 values array memory
* 6 parameters per function
* 6 nested ifs
* 126 operators
* 126 native functions
