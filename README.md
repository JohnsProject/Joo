## The Joo programming language
Is a clean, fast, static typed, general purpose language. 

It's primarily thought to be compiled to joo bytecode and executed by the virtual machine.

## The joo byte code language

## The Joo virtual machine
is a virtual computer that can be programmed using the joo bytecode. It's designed to
be easilly extensible and customizable.

virtual machine tech specs:
* 1024 characters program memory
* 64 variables + functions + arrays
* 108 values array memory
* 6 parameters per function
