=================== Joo SDK help
To use the joo sdk you need write the joo command followed by other commands
that will tell the joo sdk what to do. The Allowed commands are:

-compile <file path>  Compiles the joo code at the given path.
-create <file path>  Creates a file with the joo template code at the given path.
-help  Shows this help message.

Usage of commands is like "joo -compile <file path>"
It's also allowed to run joo code at a path by using the command

joo <file path>

If the file ends with '.joo' a '.cjoo' file is created and then executed.
If the file ends with '.cjoo' the bytecode is executed.
